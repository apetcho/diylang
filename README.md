# DIYLANG: Do It Yourself Language
The codes available in this project are mostly based on 
![compiler tasks][rosetta]. The main purpose is to learn how to implement
a tiny programming language.

The components of the *diylang* as implemented here are:

- Lexical analyzer
- Syntax analyzer
- Interpreter
- Code generator
- Virtual machine
